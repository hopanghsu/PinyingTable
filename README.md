# Overview

PinyinTable is a WebExtension, which aims at helping people move to this input
method (IM) more easily before fully memorizing the entire ZhuYin to PinYin
table while browsing.

# Future Work

2. Move the PinyingTable to an div injected into the content for a better UX.
3. Move the PinyingTable to sidebar (Waiting for the necessary WebAPIs).
